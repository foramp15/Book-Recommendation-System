# Recommendation_Systems
In this project, I implemented the book recommendation system based on the similarity measure between users and items(books). Pearson Correlation and cosine similarity are the two similarity metrics that I have used to make recommendations.
The dataset used is the popular Book-Crossing dataset that can be downloaded from the given url: http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/
The Book_RS_Pearson.ipynb makes recommendation using Pearson correlation metric, whereas Book_RS_Knn.ipynb recommends book using K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN) algorithm and cosine similarity measure.
